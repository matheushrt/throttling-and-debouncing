  <h1>Throttling and Debouncing</h1>

```
Both of them are ways to limit the amount of JavaScript you are executing based on DOM events for performance reasons.
```

```
Take a look at the implementation of both and open `index.html` to play around with the `text input` to visualize the difference between these two concepts.
```

#### Throttling:

```javascript
function throttle(func, delay) {
  let shouldRun = true;

  return (...args) => {
    if (shouldRun) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        func(...args);
        shouldRun = true;
      }, delay);
    }
    shouldRun = false;
  };
}
```

#### Debouncing:

```javascript
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  return (...args) => {
    let timeout;
    clearTimeout(timeout, (timeout = setTimeout(fn, delay, ...args)));
  };
}
```
